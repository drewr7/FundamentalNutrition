# FundamentalNutrition

My project is a nutrition application, that allows users to create accounts enter their weight, gender, activity level and it will provide them with their daily macronutrients. I will also provide a list of approved foods, philosophy of my app and calcualtions, as well as FAQ. I will use REACT to create the app with a SQL backend to store user information. I am still deciding on the other technologies i will be using to complete my app as well as additional features. 

The problem my application will solve is to provide people with the knowledge regarding nutrition and portions for weight loss.
